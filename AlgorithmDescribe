1) We read the data from stl file.
2) Create object class Vertex which contained follow info:
	a) Array of elements with which current vertex connected;
	b) The distance to each of these vertex;
	c) Itself position (x,y,z).
2) User input the coords of start and end vertex position.
3) We get start from the first vertex and look over all possible vertices with which the current have connection.
4) If short way to next vertex is greater then sum of distance to current vertex and 
distance from current vertex to next then value of short way to the next vertex is assigned expression that i wrote above.
5) We do this until we find the end vertex.
6) So in a result we have short way between two points.

For this task i used algorithm bfs combine with Dijkstra.

Complexity of the algorithm:

O(V+E)
Where:
V - quantity of vertex;
E - quantity of all edges;
